## vtctldclient RemoveShardCell

Remove the specified cell from the specified shard's Cells list.

vtctldclient RemoveShardCell [--force|-f] [--recursive|-r] <keyspace/shard> <cell>
```

### Options

```
  -f, --force       Proceed even if the cell's topology server cannot be reached. The assumption is that you turned down the entire cell, and just need to update the global topo data.

  -r, --recursive   Also delete all tablets in that cell beloning to the specified shard.
